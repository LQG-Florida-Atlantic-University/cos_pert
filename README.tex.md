1. "H.wl" contains the data $H_{ij}$ for the equations of motion of perturbations $\dot{V}^i =  \sum_j H_{ij} V^j$.

2. "Hc.wl" contains the continuum limit of $H_{ij}$.

3. "data.zip" contains the following useful data:

   - "hamcon.wl" contains the continumm limit of the second order Hamiltonian.
   - "gauss.wl" contains the first order continumm Gauss constraints.
   - "hamd.wl" contains the first order discrete Hamiltonian.
   - "clo.wl" contains the first order discrete closure constraints.
   - "Nshiftd.wl" contains the first order discrete shift vectors.
   
4. "continuum_limit.nb" computes the continuum limit of EoMs of perturbations and compares the result with EoMs from the system of classical Gravity coupled to dust.  

4. "late_time_tensor.nb" computes the limit of late time EoMs of perturbations where one can find the late time dispersion relation of the tensor mode.
