1. "H.wl" contains the data $H_{ij}$ for the equations of motion of perturbations $V^i =  \sum_j H_{ij} V^j$.

2. "Hc.wl" contains the continuum limit of $H_{ij}$.

3. "data.zip" contains the following useful data:
   -"hamcon.wl" contains the continumm limit of the second order Hamiltonian.
   -"gauss.wl" contains the first order continumm Gauss constraint.
   -"hamd.wl" contains the first order discrete Hamiltonian.
   -"clo.wl" contains the first order discrete closure constraint.
   -"Nshiftd.wl" contains the first order discrete shift vector.
